// The operations.go file is meant to provide a common approach to planning,
// executing, and completing changes to the storage clusters under heketi
// management as well as accurately reflecting these changes in the heketi db.
//
// We define the Operation interface and helper functions that use the
// interface to create a uniform style for making high-level changes to the
// system. We also provide various concrete operation structs such as for
// volume create or volume delete to actually perform the actions.

// Operation is an interface meant to encapsulate any high-level action
// where we need to build and store data structures that reflect our
// pending state, execute actions to apply our configuration to the
// managed cluster(s), and then either record the data structures as final
// or roll back to the previous state on error.

	// of the operation and will be passed up to the API on successful
