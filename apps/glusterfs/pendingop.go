// The pendingop.go file defines the basic structures needed to track

// levels of objects which we track: the pending operation a higher-level
// operation that should roughly correspond to an action in the Heketi API,
// and lower level change tracking where individual object creates, deletes,
// and modifications are logged. Note that objects such as bricks and
// volumes are still managed in their own buckets. The pending operation
// metadata tracks the IDs of these objects and these objects have references
// back to their associated pending operations (via IDs).

// PendingOperationType identifies what kind of high-level operation a
// PendingOperation will be.
