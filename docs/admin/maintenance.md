# Overview

Heketi allows administrators to add and remove storage capacity by managing
one or more GlusterFS clusters.

# Adding Capacity

There are multiple ways to add additional storage capacity using Heketi.
One can add new devices, increase the cluster size, or add an entirely
new cluster.

## Adding new devices

When adding more devices, please keep in mind to add devices as a set.
For example, if volumes are using replica 2 you should add a device to two
nodes (one device per node). If using replica 3, then add a device to three
nodes.

Devices can be added to nodes by directly accessing the
[Heketi API](../api/api.md).

Using the Heketi cli, a single device can be added to a node:

```
$ heketi-cli device add \
      --name=/dev/sdb
      --node=3e098cb4407d7109806bb196d9e8f095
```

A much simpler way to add many devices at once is to add the new device
to the node description in your topology file used to setup the cluster.
Then rerun the command to load the new topology.
Here is an example where we added a new `/dev/sdj` drive to the node:

```
$ heketi-cli topology load --json=topology.json
...
        Found node 192.168.10.100 on cluster 3e21671bc4f290fca6bce464ae7bb6e7
                Found device /dev/sdb
                Found device /dev/sdc
                Found device /dev/sdd
                Found device /dev/sde
                Found device /dev/sdf
                Found device /dev/sdg
                Found device /dev/sdh
                Found device /dev/sdi
                Adding device /dev/sdj ... OK
...
```

## Increasing cluster size

In addition to adding new devices to existing nodes new nodes can be
added to the cluster. As with devices one can add a new node to an
existing cluster by either using the [API](../api/api.md), using the cli,
or modifying your topology file.

The following shows an example of how to add a new node using the cli:

```
$ heketi-cli node add \
      --zone=3 \
      --cluster=3e21671bc4f290fca6bce464ae7bb6e7 \
      --management-host-name=node1-manage.gluster.lab.com \
      --storage-host-name=172.18.10.53

Node information:
Id: e0017385b683c10e4166492e78832d09
State: online
Cluster Id: 3e21671bc4f290fca6bce464ae7bb6e7
Zone: 3
Management Hostname node1-manage.gluster.lab.com
Storage Hostname 172.18.10.53

$ heketi-cli device add \
      --name=/dev/sdb \
      --node=e0017385b683c10e4166492e78832d09
Device added successfully

$ heketi-cli device add \
      --name=/dev/sdc \
      --node=e0017385b683c10e4166492e78832d09
Device added successfully
```

## Adding a new cluster

Storage capacity can also be increased by adding new clusters of GlusterFS.
Just as before, one can use the [API](../api/api.md) directly, use the
`heketi-cli` to manually add clusters, nodes and devices, or create another
topology file to define the new nodes and devices which will compose this
cluster.

# Reducing Capacity

Heketi also supports the reduction of storage capacity. This is possible
by deleting devices, nodes, and clusters. These changes can be
performed  using the [API](../api/api.md) directly or by using `heketi-cli`.
Here is an example of how to delete devices with no volumes from Heketi:
