# Launch the Guestbook example in Kubernetes. This will use the pod and service
# definitions from `files/guestbook-example/*.yaml` to launch a leader/follower
# redis cluster, with a web-front end to collect user data and store in redis.
# This example app can easily scale across multiple nodes, and exercises the
# networking, pod creation/scale, service definition, and replica controller of
# kubernetes.
